# TODO-List

## Only those stupid conceptual tasks
- Is `fn(i : int)` equivalent to `fn(j : int)` or not? (name equality)
	- Mostly bullshit and not the expected behaviour...
- Is `fn(this i : int)` equivalent to `fn(i : int)` or not? (`this` prefix equality)
	- Would also be bullshit to have `this` modify equality

## Actual programming tasks
- Update function type equality
-
